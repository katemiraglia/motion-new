                    <br><br>We are a curator of second-hand 80s, 90s, and early 2000s vintage apparel. We look to acquire all of our pieces ethically and sustainably. We find our clothes right before they make their last stop in a landfill. Our team works hard to keep our impact on our local area neutal. We try to avoid taking thrifted goods from those that really need them by waiting until later in the day to source our products. By doing this we are able to sort through tons of clothes that are set to be put into a landfill.  </p>
